2015 Senior Design 

So here we can just have a running text file of what we are tryign to decide on...

So far: 

Willie's Choices: 
My choices are android pc, blockly, Add UCD Food vendors into well used food databases, and stebbins app

Ramya's Choices: 
My choices are:
#38: Droplet Image Analysis Software
This work is in support of NASA research that focuses on droplet combustion experiments on the International Space Station.
#2: Google Glass Quadcopter 
Control of a programmable quadcopter through Google Glass and display and recording of flight data, event-triggered videos and images.
#18: Stebbins App
Students would create an app to enrich the experience of visitors to Stebbins, possibly including: trail maps and guides, plant and animal checklists and identification guides, data-entry portals for citizen scientists.
#2: Blockley for Robot Simulation 
The C-STEM Center, in collaboration with our industry partners, has developed innovative educational computing using a user friendly C/C++ interpreter Ch and robotics technologies for K-14 hands-on learning.
and that's my list of 4. I need to poke around a bit within the hour for the other 2 I think I could be interested in.
Also, is everyone here allright with github? that seems the way to go with tracking our code and such.
